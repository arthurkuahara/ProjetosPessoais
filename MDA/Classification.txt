What is the fundamental difference that makes a labelling obtained from a classification differ from that of 
a clustering?

The fundamental difference between classification and clustering is that classification is a supervised learning 
approach where a specific label is provided to the machine to classify new observations, whereas clustering is an 
unsupervised learning approach where grouping is done on similarities basis without the help of class labels.
