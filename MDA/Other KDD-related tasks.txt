1. What is the difference between a supervised and an unsupervised task? Can you give examples of such tasks? What does it entail for their quality assessment?
2. What is dimensionality reduction? Different algorithms reduce the number of dimensions for different purposes. Which purposes?
3. Can you give two reasons to do a Principle Component Analysis?

1. 

In a supervised task, the learning algorithm is provided with labeled data, where each data point is 
associated with a known target or output variable.

In an unsupervised task, the learning algorithm does not have access to labeled data or target variables.
In supervised tasks, the quality assessment typically involves evaluating the accuracy or predictive performance 
of the model using labeled test data. 

In unsupervised tasks, the quality assessment is often more subjective and challenging since there are no explicit 
target variables to compare against. Evaluation metrics depend on the specific unsupervised task. For example, in 
clustering, metrics such as silhouette score or purity can be used to assess the quality of cluster assignments. 
However, since unsupervised learning aims to discover unknown patterns or structures, the interpretation and 
evaluation of results often involve human judgment, domain knowledge, or downstream tasks.

2. 

Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of input features or dimensions in a 
dataset while preserving its essential structure or information. It is commonly used in data preprocessing and 
analysis to overcome the curse of dimensionality, improve computational efficiency, visualize high-dimensional 
data, remove redundant or irrelevant features, and enhance model performance.

Some purposes : Feature Selection, Feature Extraction (PCA), Compression (SVD).

Dimensionality Reduction - PCA allows for a lower-dimensional representation of the data. Overcomes the curse of dimensionality
Data Visualization - PCA can be used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.
